# CoinView: Explore the World of Cryptocurrencies

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. CoinView is a dynamic web application designed to provide insightful views into the cryptocurrency market through the Coinmarketcap API. This project was an exciting journey into leveraging AI tools to enhance data interaction and presentation. The upcoming version plans to introduce gamification elements to transform the way users engage with and learn from cryptocurrency market data.

## Getting Started

To use CoinView, you'll need to obtain a Coinmarketcap API key to fetch the latest cryptocurrency data. Here's how you can get your API key:

1. [Visit Coinmarketcap's API page.](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/)
2. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory of your project.
3. Add your API key to `.env.local` like so:

   ```
   CMC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   API_ENDPOINT=https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com
   Replace your_api_key_here with the API key you obtained from Coinmarketcap.
   ```

### Next, get your development server running:

#### Choose the package manager you have and run the corresponding command:

```npm run dev
yarn dev
pnpm dev
bun dev
```

After starting the server, visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application in action. Modify app/page.tsx as needed and watch your updates appear in real time.
